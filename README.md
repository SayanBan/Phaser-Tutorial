Phaser is a free software 2D game framework for making HTML5 games for desktop and mobile. It is developed by Photon Storm. 
Phaser uses both a Canvas and WebGL renderer internally and can automatically swap between them based on browser support. 
This allows for fast rendering across desktop and mobile.

Stable release: 3.20.0 / 12 October 2019
